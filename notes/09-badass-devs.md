How do we create badass devs? Learn about how the human brain functions, and with this knowledge, how to get better way faster.  

## Notes
> "If you ask 10k people what a dev needs to know, you'll get 10k answers."
> "What do you need to know?" is the wrong question. "How can you learn to build your skills quickly?"

#### Humans, unicorns, and humanoids.
"You've been mistaken for a humanoid."  
Cognitive resources.  

Story: As an experiment, people are asked to memorize numbers. Some are asked to memorize 2 digit numbers, some are asked to memorize 7 digit numbers.  
During this, they are interruped, and asked: Do you want fruit or cake?  
Overwhelmingly, the people memorizing 7 numbers choose cake, and the people memorizing 2 choose fruit.  

> It's all one tank of resources. Willpower, memory... all one tank of resources, called cognitive resources.  
> "Do you make people choose cake?"  
> "Your open source documentation makes everyone choose cake."  

Death by a thousand **cognitive micro-leaks**.  
Expertise requires **cognitive resource management**.  

#### How to get way better way faster
(from a cognitive resources perspective)

A Can't do  
B Can do with effort  
C Mastered

Pile up on B  
  Too many cognitive resources getting drained  

Half-assed skills on C  
  Nobody wants to pull it back and refine it  

It takes too long. This is a slow process

Fixing the pile-up on B  
  Solution: Keep things on A  
  Split B into subskills, and take those subskills to C.  

half-a-skill beats a half-assed-skill  

Take a skill from can't do to mastered within:  
max 3 sessions  
max 45-90 minutes/session  
If you can't do this, the thing is too big.  

Practice does not make perfect. Practice makes permanent.  

Think: What's on your C?  

> "We need to bypass B where we can."  

Speed up A and B. "Speed up A to B to C."  
Story about chick sexers (determing gender of chicks)  
  Pair beginners with experts.  
  Beginners got better without ever knowing how they got better.  
  Plane-spotting WW2  
    Same story  

> "This is the thing about experts. They don't know how they know, they just know."  

#### Perceptual Learning
Pilot story:  
They took non-pilots and paired them with pilots. After 3 hours...  
Non-pilots out-scored seasoned pilots (pilots with 1k-2k hours of flight time)  

Why is this not used?  
This is called **perceptual learning**.  

We need high-quality, high-quantity examples  
This is what we don't do. We just see 2 or 3 examples, like in a textbook or something.  

"Look at the people around you. They are not humanoids, or unicorns, they are... humans. And just visualize them bleeding out of cognitive resources."

## Action Items
* [ ] Utilize the A-B-C method for learning
* [ ] Try perceptual learning
* [ ] Don't bleed out your cognitive resources
